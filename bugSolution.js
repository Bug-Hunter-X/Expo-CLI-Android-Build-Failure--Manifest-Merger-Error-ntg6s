The solution depends on the exact nature of the manifest merger error. Carefully analyze the complete error log to identify the conflicting manifest entries. Common causes include conflicting activity declarations, service definitions, permissions, or other elements. You may need to adjust your `app/build.gradle` or `AndroidManifest.xml` file. For example:

1. **Resolve Conflicts:** If the error points to specific conflicts (e.g., two libraries declare the same activity), you may need to modify the library configuration or carefully merge the conflicting elements. 
2. **Use Merge Tags:** Use `<merge/>` in your `AndroidManifest.xml` to consolidate similar sections properly. 
3. **Check Dependencies:** Check for conflicting dependencies that may be causing the problem. Consider updating or removing redundant libraries.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, a simple clean and rebuild can resolve transient issues. Run `./gradlew clean` followed by the build command.
